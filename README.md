# Hypercasual-Games

I collaborated in three hypercasual games development, from the idea to the distribution stages, for Blue Monkey Studio as an intern.

Frog Run is a platform game where we control a frog. The frog uses its sticky and elastic tongue to propel itself through every level. By eating fireflies, the frog gets bigger and heavier, allowing it to break obstacles on its path. The goal is to reach the finish line, there is no lose condition.

Flip & Snap is a puzzle where the player has to complete a pixelart on a grid by moving colorful 3D pieces in its right place. You can find money on the grid, and use it to skip a piece if you find it too hard. Levels are sorted by themes like animals or flags, and each theme ends with a special level. When the player seems to have completed the level, it continues on a second layer. Once a theme is done, the player wins a badge he can see in its collection in the menu.

Light the Fuse is an other puzzle game in a grid. This gris is full of tiles with a fuse inside. Each fuse is connected to some of the adjacent tiles. When the player touch a tile, it rotates. At the bottom of the grid, flames are ready to consume the fuses, and at the top fireworks are waiting to be launched. When the player creates a path between a flame and a firework, the entire path is consumed and the fireworks launches, giving the player a score depending on the number of rockets lighted and the combos. The goal is to maximize your score in limited tries.

For more information about the games or my role in their development, please consider checking the internship report. For now it is in french, but an english version may arrive soon.
There is no code associated to the repository here, for obvious reasons such as company rights.
